# Gitflow requirement for developer in this project

- **Don't** commit into develop or main branch. If you want to develop a new feature, create a new branch from develop branch with naming convention: feature/**&lt;_your-site_&gt;**/**&lt;_feature-name_&gt;**. Example: `feature/frontend/login-page`
- Do not merge your feature branch into develop branch. Create a pull request and assign reviewer to review your code.
- Do not merge your feature branch into develop branch until your code is approved by reviewer.
- Before making a merge request, make sure to fetch the changes on the upstream repo and resolve all conflicts in your code (if it took too much time, try to notify and discuss with the team member whose code conflicted with you or the team leader)
- If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the **Slack** group.
- Have fun coding!
