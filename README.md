# For dev

- **Don't** commit into develop branch. If you want to develop a new feature, create a new branch from develop branch with naming convention: feature/**&lt;_your-site_&gt;**/**&lt;_feature-name_&gt;**. Example: `feature/frontend/login-page`
- Do not merge your feature branch into develop branch. Create a pull request and assign reviewer to review your code.
- Do not merge your feature branch into develop branch until your code is approved by reviewer.
- If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the **Slack** group.
- Have fun coding!
